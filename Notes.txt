elevator level statuses - doors open or doors closed, moving or stopped if moving direction 
present position 
destination queue
	After every call, the entire state of the elevator system is sent to the elevator optimizer. 
This returns what elevator to send to the request. Each request has an id made up of build_id, floor_id
Multiple requests will still only apply to one elevator system state. 

In the first place, with the dispatcher function, we can check if someone has called the elevator, and checks at which floor its the call.

Next, an elevator will be selected for going to the call and after that, the elevator is put into a queue, so he doesn't just get all the calls and doesn't override them.

Then the elevator closes its doors and goes to the floor where it's called after he reaches the floor he stops and waits for a button to be pressed inside the elevator.

After waiting for the doors to be closed he moves to the floor where the passenger wanted to go to.

For every state that the elevator is(Open, Closed, Stoped) I attributed a color to represent what is happening. Red is for idle, green is for moving and gray is for closing doors.
	
Unfortunately, I wanted to have a display to indicate at what floors the elevators are, in which direction are they going, and their state, but I didn't manage to dit it.
